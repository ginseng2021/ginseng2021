- 👋 Hi, I’m @ginseng2021
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my life to be more mobile, by starting a new career that allows that
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java and planning to learn python or kotlin soon after
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects in java after I've learned enough language and external libraries.  Perhaps some android apps either using java or kotlin.
- 📫 How to reach me?  I don't know, doesn't github have an emailbox for me?
